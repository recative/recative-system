# TN7002: Time Synchronization

## Introduction

For video playback, Recative System split the video file into two different
file: the muted video file and the audio file. For most browsers:

- Muted video files can be played automatically without users' interaction.

- By interactive the page once (click or tap), the `AudioContext` could be
  activated, then Recative System could play any audio files without any
  limitation.

So we can achieve unlimited auto play by playing muted video and its sound in
`AudioContext`.

Since they are played with two different Web API, the time of two different
files could be uncoordinated. So we need a tool to synchronize the time of
different channel.

This is managed by the [`@recative/time-schedule`](/api/time-schedule).

## Architecture

### Timeline

For each asset, there is an instance handle all the time synchronization related
tasks. This timeline will manage audio, video and logic produced by the act
point.

### Tracks

Each timeline managed a lot of [Tracks](/api/time-schedule/interface/Track). For
all type of asset, there is a monitor track:

- **AudioTrack**: Audio track will track the loading and the progress of [audio elements](/docs/technotes/tn7001-audio-management#audio-elements)
  for most cases, audio tracks would not be synchronized.

- **RemoteTrack**: Remote track will handle general progress management logic
  for the logic which is hard to abstract, Recative System use Remote Track to
  manage the progress of video playback and animation of act point.

- **MonitorTrack**: Monitor track do not report any progress, but trigger events
  while _time updated_ and the content _stuck_.

While adding the track to the timeline, developers could specify a priority for
that track, while there is out of sync happened, the time of all other tracks
will follow the time of the track with the highest priority. This is designed to
minimize the user's perception while time synchronization happens.

Compared to visual information, users are more sensitive to the glitch of
auditory information, so we tend to give higher priority to audio information
and adjust the timing of visual components rather than sound when the
tracks appear uncoordinated.

## Integration

Each [`ContentInstance`](https://github.com/recative/recative-system/blob/dbbd9e210a7dae7d73961ded36f4595866e7b815/packages/core-manager/src/instance.ts#L60)
have a member called [`timeline`](https://github.com/recative/recative-system/blob/dbbd9e210a7dae7d73961ded36f4595866e7b815/packages/core-manager/src/instance.ts#L84)

Most tracks will [be added to the timeline](https://github.com/recative/recative-system/blob/dbbd9e210a7dae7d73961ded36f4595866e7b815/packages/core-manager/src/instance.ts#L159-L168)
while the asset is initialized, but some track [could be added later](https://github.com/recative/recative-system/blob/dbbd9e210a7dae7d73961ded36f4595866e7b815/packages/core-manager/src/instance.ts#L263).

- **AudioTrack**: Audio track [will be initialized within the constructor of `ContentInstance`](https://github.com/recative/recative-system/blob/dbbd9e210a7dae7d73961ded36f4595866e7b815/packages/core-manager/src/instance.ts#L103).
  Then [act player](/api/act-player) will [notify](https://github.com/recative/recative-system/blob/dbbd9e210a7dae7d73961ded36f4595866e7b815/packages/act-player/src/components/Stage/Video.tsx#L242)
  the track about the URL and backend of the audio resource by passing the
  [definition](/api/definitions/interface/IResourceFile) of the file.

- **MonitorTrack**: Monitor track will also be added while the `ContentInstance`
  is [initializing](https://github.com/recative/recative-system/blob/dbbd9e210a7dae7d73961ded36f4595866e7b815/packages/core-manager/src/instance.ts#L161-L164),
  all event listeners about the `stuck` and time `update` event will be bind
  here.

- **RemoteTrack**: [The remote track](https://github.com/recative/recative-system/blob/dbbd9e210a7dae7d73961ded36f4595866e7b815/packages/core-manager/src/instance.ts#L263)
  will manage the progress of the video channel and the act point. It is added
  while the [state](/docs/technotes/tn9002-episode-core#lifecycle) of the asset
  turns to `preloading`. Then the `Video` React component will [report stuck](https://github.com/recative/recative-system/blob/dbbd9e210a7dae7d73961ded36f4595866e7b815/packages/act-player/src/components/Stage/Video.tsx#L117),
  [unstuck](https://github.com/recative/recative-system/blob/dbbd9e210a7dae7d73961ded36f4595866e7b815/packages/act-player/src/components/Stage/Video.tsx#L101)
  [progress and state](https://github.com/recative/recative-system/blob/dbbd9e210a7dae7d73961ded36f4595866e7b815/packages/act-player/src/components/Stage/Video.tsx#L327-L328)
  via the [`functionForComponents`](https://github.com/recative/recative-system/blob/dbbd9e210a7dae7d73961ded36f4595866e7b815/packages/core-manager/src/episodeCore.ts#L558)
  for [interface components](/docs/technotes/tn8001-act-player#:~:text=interface%20implementation).
