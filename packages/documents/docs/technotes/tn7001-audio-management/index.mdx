# TN7001: Audio Management

## Introduction

Media playback, especially playing media with sound is a hard-core task
since different browsers have different media playback strategy:

- Chromium requires user interact (click or touch) with the page at least once,
  all audios could be played automatically.
- Safari requires user manually trigger the audio playback.
- Firefox have a site-by-site configuration panel for their user.
- Chromium or Safari based WebView, or GeckoView have their own API to decide
  if the browser should allow auto play or not.

To handle these complex problem Recative System created a consistence audio
experience across all major browser platforms. This feature is enabled by
[`@recative/audio-station`](https://recative.github.io/api/audio-station) and
[`@recative/phonograph`](https://recative.github.io/api/phonograph),
which created a global `AudioContext`, and manually manage the media playback
related work instead of using
[HTMLMediaElement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement).

:::info
However, this architecture has its own limitation: user still have to interact
with the page at once to enable the global audio context, so we can take over
the job of audio playback management.
:::

This tech note will give a brief introduction about the architecture design of
the audio management system.

# Initialization

`AudioStation` maintain a singleton of audio context and the audio station
manager, user need to call the
[`getGlobalAudioStation`](http://localhost:3000/api/audio-station/function/getGlobalAudioStation)
method to
[interact with the manager](https://github.com/recative/recative-system/blob/bbc22e46471e4516333525819a24b111c167b9ed/packages/core-manager/src/episodeCore.ts#L105).

```TypeScript
const audioStation = getGlobalAudioStation();
```

Then, user need to call the `activate` method in the synchronous call stack
callback of any click and touch event, the audio station will work after the
returned promise resolved.

```TypeScript
audioStation.activate().then(() => {
  console.log('You can make some noise here now!');
});
```

# Architecture

Audio is managed in a three level model, with different kind of audio backend:

- **Audio Host**: There is an audio host [for each asset](https://github.com/recative/recative-system/blob/df61508153b79018f530f4552b8fbc72df341569/packages/core-manager/src/instance.ts#L110)
  called [`AudioHost`](https://github.com/recative/recative-system/blob/df61508153b79018f530f4552b8fbc72df341569/packages/core-manager/src/audio/audioHost.ts#L152),
  it will handle resource loading, playback, destroy, volume manage and subtitle
  management for different audio files.

* [**LoadableAudioElement**](https://github.com/recative/recative-system/blob/df61508153b79018f530f4552b8fbc72df341569/packages/core-manager/src/audio/audioHost.ts#L22):
  Build a general abstract interface for different type of audio backend. This
  level of abstraction will hold the loading status of the audio file.

* **AudioElement**: Did the actual logic for downloading file, controlling
  the volume, seeking to different time and all operations about an audio file.
  There are two different type of audio elements.

### Audio Elements

Recative System has two builds in implementations for different use cases, The
implementation of audio elements extensible, which means developers cannot
write their own AudioElement implementations.

- **BasicAudioElement**: This is the naïve implementation for audio playback,
  the codec support is aligned with user's browser. Audio files managed by
  this kind of audio element is playable if and only if all contents are
  downloaded and decoded. The data will be stored in the [PCM format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-code_modulation)
  without any compression, so be caution that developers should not play audio
  longer than 60 seconds to prevent the web page is killed by user's <span title="SAFARI!">browser</span>.
- **PhonographAudioElement**: Audio files managed by this type of audio
  element will be spliced into a lot of small fragments, the audio file is
  playable when enough fragments loaded. There are a buffer holds all the decoded
  files, only a small amount of the fragments are stored, played audio buffered
  will be destroyed instantly, so the memory usage is smaller than the
  `BasicAudioElement`, only binary that not decoded, and PCM fragments in the
  buffer will be stored in the users' memory. Please notice this audio element
  only supports the MP3 format.

:::info
There's interest to support the OGG format but not planned, let us know if you
need this feature, or even better, would like to implement this feature.

## Usage

For developers that using Recative Studio, open the resource tab of the resource
manager, double click the audio resource to open the resource editing modal,
and tick the _Enable Phonograph backend_ checkbox, your resource will be played
using the `PhonographAudioElement` to manage the audio file.

For developers who are writing resource definitions manually, write a key with:

```
'@recative/extension-audio-backends/PhonographAudioBackend~~backend'
```

with the value `yes`, inside the [`extensionConfiguration`](/api/definitions/interface/IResourceFile#extensionConfigurations)
field, the core manager will use the phonograph audio backend now.
