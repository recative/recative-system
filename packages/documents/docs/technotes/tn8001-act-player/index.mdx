# TN8001: Act Player: Episode Level Media Playback

## Introduction

Act player implemented a React binding of Episode Core, it implemented all user
interfaces of the player, and built a bridge from your asset to the episode
core.

Act player provideds a build-in interface implementation, which provides:

- **Loading Indicator:** This component will be shown if the metadata or content
  is not loaded, or the buffer of the video have drained.

- **Subtitle:** This will show subtitle of your video content or audio clip
  inside the act point program.

- **Dialog Component:** That show additional information on the right side of
  your content, it looks like the information card of YouTube, but can display
  more type of information, like texture, and audio.

- **Controller:** Pause and play, setting content language, volume, navigating
  to different assets and time, and more fundenmental elements for a player.

- **Stage:** All assets are placed inside the stage, it will create and destory
  React Elements for different contents, and connect these contents with
  _Core Manager_.

## Essential parts of a player

The components we introduced above are default implementation for the player,
developers can pass their own
[interface component](/api/act-player/interface/IUnmanagedActPointProps#interfaceComponents)
into the player and customize the visual experience and functionality of the
player. All interface components are React components, they are stored in an
array, they will be rendered in the player container.

## Interface component

We have to make the component met specific
[typing signiture](/api/act-player#InterfaceExtensionComponent) to make sure
_Core Manager_ and _Act Player_ can communicate with the component
implementation, basically, we will pass two parameters:

- **`core`:** A instance of the _Episode Core_, we can use this parameter to
  control most behavior of the player.

- **`loadingComponent`:** A component that indicate something is still loading,
  you can show this component if something is stilling being cooked.

After the component is created, we can start to interact with the _Episode Core_.

### Different type of interface components

There're different type of interface components, you can choose one based on
your technical requirement.

- **Naïve components:** If we don't need let the _Episode Core_ to control
  the lifecycle of the component, this component is a naïve component, we don't
  need to do anything special.

- **Managed components:** Managed components hooked up with the life cycle
  management process of the _Episode Core_,
  [component functions](/api/core-manager/interface/ComponentFunctions). Here are
  some use cases:

  - **A play button layer:** if the media playback was paused, ask core
    call the `pause` function we provided via `componentFunctions`. When the
    function was called, we show the large "play" button.
  - **A transition animation layer:** show an animation while switching between
    assets above the player, which can hide the underlying resource loading
    process. we use `shouldBlockContentSwitch` life cycle to notify the
    _Episode Core_ that all lifecycles should be processed manually, then we
    call `unblockAssetSetup` while the "ease-in" animation was played, then call
    `unblockAssetPlay` when the "ease-out" animation was played. For more
    details, see "Switching between contents" section below.

- **Critical components:** Critical components must be registered before or the
  player won't process any incoming requests. There is currently only one
  critical component called `stage`. Critical component could be naïve or
  managed.

:::info
Stage will show all assets available in an episode. The stage component should
implement methods that create, destroy, show, hide content in its
`ComponentFunctions`, for more detail, checkout the
[source code](https://github.com/recative/recative-system/blob/master/packages/act-player/src/components/Stage/Stage.tsx).

Assets inside the stage components are implemented by _asset instance components_
like [videos](https://github.com/recative/recative-system/blob/master/packages/act-player/src/components/Stage/ActPoint.tsx)
and [act points](https://github.com/recative/recative-system/blob/master/packages/act-player/src/components/Stage/ActPoint.tsx).
The API for both of them is quite similar to that of _interface components_, but
we do not support third-party interface components implementations.
