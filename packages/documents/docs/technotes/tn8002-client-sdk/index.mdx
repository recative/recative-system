# TN8002: Client SDK: Series Level Media Playback

## Introduction

An client SDK will manage the media playback task across different episodes, and
related data loading tasks:

- **Data Loading:** Client SDK will manage the metadata fetching and decoding
  related task. Recative Studio supports encoding the data in multiple formats
  for different use cases. Client SDK provides a consistent way to fetch the
  data.

- **Router Management:** Client SDK will manage the switching task between
  different episodes, including destroying old player, creating new player and
  manage related lifecycle.

- **Interface Customization:** Recative System provides a very flexible and
  decoupling way to customize most detail about how the play works.

## Usage

### Initializing

Developers can use the client SDK by using the `ContentModuleFactory`, this is
a component factory, developers provides the URL pattern of the metadata file
and the component factory returns a React component that handles the episode
switching automatically. Here is an example:

```ts
import { ContentModuleFactory } from '@recative/client-sdk';

const Content = ContentModuleFactory(
  'https://recative.github.io/production/$fileName',
  'uson'
);
```

It is safe to memo the `Content` component if the parameters are controlled
by React.

```ts
const Player: React.FC = () => {
  const config = useSomeConfig();

  const Content = React.useMemo(
    () => ContentModuleFactory(config.pathPattern, config.dataType),
    [config.pathPattern, config.dataType]
  );

  // now you can use the content component like: <Content />
};
```
