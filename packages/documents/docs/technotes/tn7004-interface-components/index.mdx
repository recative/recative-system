# TN7004: Building a Customized Interface

## Abstract

The Recative System recommend writing your customized interface by injecting
custom proprieties to the React component, this article will introduce the
essentials of building a interface component.

## Getting started

To get started building your customized interface, we need to setup a new
package which generates a single file CommonJS module, we recommend using Parcel
v2 to build the module.

Here's a recommended configuration snippiest:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "prepack": "yarn clean && yarn build",
    "clean": "rimraf ./dist",
    "watch": "parcel watch",
    "build": "parcel build",
    "reset": "rimraf ./dist ./.parcel-cache"
  },
  "targets": {
    "main": false,
    "module": false,
    "types": false,
    "containerComponents": {
      "source": "src/containerComponents.ts",
      "distDir": "dist/player",
      "outputFormat": "commonjs",
      "optimize": false,
      "includeNodeModules": false,
      "isLibrary": true
    }
  },
  "externals": {
    "baseui": true,
    "react": true,
    "react-dom": true
  }
}
```

## Building customized interface components

Interface components are elements that stack with each other, each component
provides different features.

It's possible to build up your very own features by modifying the default
appearance and behavior of the default one. Developers need to export a variable
called `interfaceComponents`, the value is an array of React components. The
`act-player` will provide two parameters to the component: `core` and
`loadingComponent`.

Checkout [the document of the `act-player`](/docs/technotes/tn8001-act-player#interface-component)
to gain some conceptual information about interface components.

If you would like to register your component to the core, which can make sure
it can be controlled by the lifecycle management mechanism, consider using the
[`use-constant`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/use-constant) to store a
singleton instance of registered component lifecycle management interface.

Here is an example about how to register the component:

```typescript
const core = useConstant(() => {
  const coreFunctions = props.core.registerComponent(
    YOUR_COMPONENT_ID,
    YOUR_COMPONENT_FUNCTIONS
  );

  return coreFunctions;
});
```

The component ID is a string, which should be unique among other interface
components, and component functions is an object, which contains multiple
functions that could let the [episode core](/docs/technotes/tn9002-episode-core)
to control the behavior of your component, for detailed typing information,
checkout the [API reference](/api/core-manager/interface/ComponentFunctions).

the `registerComponent` method will return [a set of functions](/api/core-manager/interface/CoreFunctions) which allow
developers to control the behavior of the [episode core](/docs/technotes/tn9002-episode-core),
and this is the only recommend way to control the episode core.

## Wrapping the player

For features that happened across different episodes, developers could export
a variable named `ContainerComponent`, this is fulfilled by the series core.

Container component won't be reloaded among episodes, and while [related
parameters](/api/client-sdk/interface/IContainerComponentProps) changed, the
component will be notified.

Some suitable use cases are implementing global payment service, building
transition animations and more.

## Injecting parameters

If you want to control more detailed behavior of different parts of the player,
parameter injection provides a possible approach. This is made possible by
exporting a React hook, named `usePlayerProps`.

The `@recative/client-sdk` will provide [several parameters](/api/client-sdk/interface/InjectedProps)
to the hook, and the the hook should return an object which contains the
[additional proprieties](/api/client-sdk/interface/IInjectorProps) which need to
be injected to several destinations.
